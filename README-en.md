## **How to Play**
The game's engine consists of Vulpes jumping over enemies as they come to meet him. Press <Enter> or <Arrow Up> to jump. The game has some power ups: **chicken**, gives you a 30 second shield without taking damage, and **bunny**, gives you extra life. <br>

## **Technology**
This game was made using the P5.js library. To animate the sprites, the movement must be in a single image. Inside the ```helper.js``` file, there is a function called geradorDeMatriz. It is used to take any sprite image and read the position of each one, without having to make calculations. The order of the parameters are: ** number of lines **, ** number of columns **, ** width of the individual image of the character ** and ** height of the individual image of the character **.
To know the height and width of the character's image, just take the height of the image and divide by the number of lines; and the width of the image and divide by the number of lines.
